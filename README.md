# GPT-4 Limit Counter
This is a user script for Tampermonkey that allows users to keep track of and limit the number of messages generated by the GPT-4 model on the OpenAI Chat platform.

# Installation
To use this script, you need to have Tampermonkey installed in your browser. Tampermonkey is available for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, and Safari. You can download Tampermonkey from the official website: https://www.tampermonkey.net/.

Once you have installed Tampermonkey, click on the Tampermonkey icon in your browser, and select "Create a new script". Copy the contents of the GPT-4-Limit-Counter.js file into the script editor, and save the changes.

## Usage
Once the script is installed and enabled, it will add a message limit counter to the "Regenerate response" and "Stop generating" buttons on the OpenAI Chat platform. By default, the message limit is set to 25 messages per 3 hours.

When the user presses the "Enter" key, the message limit will be decremented by one. If the message limit reaches 0, the "Enter" key will no longer generate messages until the message limit is reset.

The script will try to detect whether GPT-4 is selected. If GPT-4 is not selected, the message limit will not be decremented.

**Note:**
If you mentioned GPT-4 in your conversation with GPT-3.5, the script will be confused and think you are talking to GPT-4.

The message limit counter will reset automatically after 3 hours, or the timer can be reset manually by refreshing the page.
